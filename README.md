# books_project
I designed a website which the books I have read are being shown. User could delete a book, edit the notes or add a new book. JS, EJS, Bootstrap, NODE, PostgreSQL are used in this project.
After making sure that you are in the directory of the project file in VS Code, type "npm i" in terminal to download the relevant packages.
Then, type "nodemon index.js" in terminal.
Finally go your web browser and type "localhost:3000" in order to see the website.
